      <description>Hi Grace, this is a page hidden in my website. I don&amp;rsquo;t think anyone can find this unless they look in my repo or know to type /grace. I think I&amp;rsquo;ll use the other website for pictures so I can just write here.
I usually address my writing to a hypothetical somebody, but I don&amp;rsquo;t think this changes much for some reason. This is what the voice in my head usually sounds like.</description>
      <content>&lt;p&gt;Hi Grace, this is a page hidden in my website. I don&amp;rsquo;t think anyone can find this unless they look in my repo or know to type /grace. I think I&amp;rsquo;ll use the other website for pictures so I can just write here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I usually address my writing to a hypothetical somebody, but I don&amp;rsquo;t think this changes much for some reason. This is what the voice in my head usually sounds like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sorry for being a bit weird earlier, you kept asking whether or not I was in class and I didn&amp;rsquo;t answer a few times. I have a habit of doing that. I think you can tell by the omission the answer to your question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;things-i-want-to-grace-but-i-dont-want-to-bother-her-right-now&#34;&gt;Things I want to Grace but I don&amp;rsquo;t want to bother her right now.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;04/13 - I had a GoogleMeet with the JFE HR lady and it was alright. I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure she thought I was punching down trying to get an internship at JFE. She said the only intern at JFE was the president&amp;rsquo;s son.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;04/14 - I hope you&amp;rsquo;re going to be okay with those injuries. Headaches aren&amp;rsquo;t fun. I got on the roof of Clav today. I had brought my lockpicks to have a go at it but the door was open. I walked around for a bit and explored the machinery. Wave hello to the construction workers on the scaffolding around Randolph.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t think it&amp;rsquo;s the fact that I can&amp;rsquo;t get a good grade on exams, it&amp;rsquo;s the fact that it feels like I can&amp;rsquo;t bring myself to do thing I should be capable of.&lt;/p&gt;
