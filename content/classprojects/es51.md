The team name comes from a great combination of CAD (Computer-Aided Design) and Harvard College's Ad Board, which oversees academic and disciplinary cases. The robot name is taken from one of the many things with the suffix -itas, which is prevalent across campus, "veritas", "securitas", "sanitas", and the thing pre-frosh joke about before coming to campus, "recinditas" or having their acceptance recinded.



Sadly, right before the bulk of our robot was suppose to be built, COVID-19 happened. 


We placed 3rd!
