# Under Construction


## Pre-face
This project was a long time in the making. During the pandemic, I was in want of exercise but my mother was too cautious to confortably let me ride my bike outside. I thought about building an indoor excercise bike that would generate electricity, and as an extra feature, generate electricity. 

Coming back to campus, I had looked forward to getting nectar funding to build the bike. Unfortunately, since we were remote for a year due to the pandemic, a lot of programs kind of fell by the wayside, and with nectar being one of them. 


Umar contacted me mid-semester about also weanting to build an e-bike. At this point, I had given up hope on getting nectar funding to build the bike and bought a Jetson Bolt Pro. I told him what I knew and to give it a try and send Rachel an email. 

She got the nectar application in the next week and we spent the week after that creating a BOM. We had put down kits from the vendor Grintech as a framework to compare other kits, motors and batteries to.

We received $1000 in nectar funding to cover the cost of the electronic components that would go on the bike and an extra $200 to cover the cost of the base bike since the bike that Umar had had dropouts that were too small.

Funding | 
--------|--------------
 $1000  | Conversion Kit, Battery
 $200   | Base Bike

We had to make sure there was enough space in the triangles of the bike to mount the battery and controller.

After the first bike was up in running, pending some brake adjustments and e-brake installation, we got started on ordering the parts for the second bike.

Since the triangles of 24" bikes are too small for a 52V downtube battery, we decided to go for a rear rack battery with 3.2AH more than a downtube.

I had bought a Mongoose 24" Excursion bike thinking I'd motorize it but the quality of the bike wasn't the best and I had to find another one. I ended getting a Schwinn Sidewinder like Umar's, 24".


## Building

During the rear wheel installation, we had many difficulties with the rear brakes to cooperate. 

### Recommended Tools

- A set of metric allen keys ()
- Small adjustable wrench (pedals, )
- Big adjustable wrench (axle nuts)
- Phillips and Flathead screwdrivers (headlights, )
- Torx screwdriver (brake disks)
- Power drill with hex driver
- Tire pump
- Zip ties for wires management

## Caring for the bike

- Charge the battery regularly so that the battery doesn't overdrain
- Running the bike at lower speeds will prolong the battery life
 

## Troubleshooting

- If you've just connected everything correctly and the motor isn't starting, check the LCD display to make the e-brakes aren't engaged.

- If the motor fails and you experience high friction when rolling the bike, disconnect the controller.
