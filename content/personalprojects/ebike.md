This project was a long time in the making. During the pandemic, I was in want of exercise but my mother was too cautious to confortably let me ride my bike outside. I thought about building an indoor excercise bike that would generate electricity, and as an extra feature, generate electricity. I thought this might help with my mom being on her phone all day 

Coming back to campus, I had looked forward to getting nectar funding to build the bike. Unfortunately, since we were remote for a year due to the pandemic, a lot of programs 


We received $1000 in nectar funding to cover the cost of the electronic components that would go on the bike and an extra $200 to cover the cost of the base bike since the bike that Umar had had dropouts that were too small.
