This project was a long time in the making. During the pandemic, I was in want of exercise but my mother was too cautious to confortably let me ride my bike outside. I thought about building an indoor excercise bike that would generate electricity, and as an extra feature, generate electricity. 

Coming back to campus, I had looked forward to getting nectar funding to build the bike. Unfortunately, since we were remote for a year due to the pandemic, a lot of programs kind of fell by the wayside, and with nectar being one of them. 

We received $1000 in nectar funding to cover the cost of the electronic components that would go on the bike and an extra $200 to cover the cost of the base bike since the bike that Umar had had dropouts that were too small.


We had to make sure there was enough space in the triangles of the bike to mount the battery and controller.
