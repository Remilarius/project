Hi Grace, this is a page hidden in my website. I don't think anyone can find this unless they look in my repo or know to type /grace. I think I'll use the other website for pictures so I can just write here. 

I usually address my writing to a hypothetical somebody, but I don't think this changes much for some reason. This is what the voice in my head usually sounds like.

Sorry for being a bit weird earlier, you kept asking whether or not I was in class and I didn't answer a few times. I have a habit of doing that. I think you can tell by the omission the answer to your question.

## Things I want to Grace but I don't want to bother her right now.

04/13 - I had a GoogleMeet with the JFE HR lady and it was alright. I'm pretty sure she thought I was punching down trying to get an internship at JFE. She said the only intern at JFE was the president's son.

04/14 - I hope you're going to be okay with those injuries. Headaches aren't fun. I got on the roof of Clav today. I had brought my lockpicks to have a go at it but the door was open. I walked around for a bit and explored the machinery. Wave hello to the construction workers on the scaffolding around Randolph.

## Musings

I don't think it's the fact that I can't get a good grade on exams, it's the fact that it feels like I can't bring myself to do thing I should be capable of.
