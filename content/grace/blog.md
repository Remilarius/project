Hi Grace, this is a page hidden in my website. I don't think anyone can find this unless they look in my repo or know to type /grace. I think I'll use the other website for pictures so I can just write here. 

I usually address my writing to a hypothetical somebody, but I don't think this changes much for some reason. This is what the voice in my head usually sounds like.

Sorry for being a bit weird earlier, you kept asking whether or not I was in class and I didn't answer a few times. I have a habit of doing that. I think you can tell by the omission the answer to your question.

## Things I want to Grace but I don't want to bother her right now.

04/13 - I had a GoogleMeet with the JFE HR lady and it was alright. I'm pretty sure she thought I was punching down trying to get an internship at JFE. She said the only intern at JFE was the president's son.

04/14 - I hope you're going to be okay with those injuries. Headaches aren't fun. I got on the roof of Clav today. I had brought my lockpicks to have a go at it but the door was open. I walked around for a bit and explored the machinery. Wave hello to the construction workers on the scaffolding around Randolph.

04/20 - I would not trade the present for the past, I still don't regret the time I spent with you, but I wonder if I had realized the dire straits I was in and taken a break, if you would still be waiting here for me.

05/19 - Getting interships in Texas and living out there for a year doesn't sound to bad honestly. I don't know if there's anything down there for you though. 

## Musings

I don't think it's the fact that I can't get a good grade on exams, it's the fact that it feels like I can't bring myself to do thing I should be capable of. 

My mind drifts towards infinty, time commits such cruelties.

It's just me against the world in every way and I'm alone. I'm alone and I'm so tired.
